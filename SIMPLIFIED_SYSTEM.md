## ✅ Simple & Effective Frontend-Only Solution

- ✅ **No backend complexity** - pure frontend license control
- ✅ **GitHub remote control** - edit JSON file to control site instantly
- ✅ **30-second updates** - site checks for changes every 30 seconds
- ✅ **Professional offline screen** - clean branded maintenance/unauthorized pages
- ✅ **Development bypass** - works normally in dev mode

## 🚀 How to Control the Site Remotely

### **Method: GitHub Raw File (Recommended)**

**One-time Setup (5 minutes):**

1. Create public GitHub repository: `akshayrajeevnambiar/license-control`
2. Add file: `seismic-ai.json` with this content:
   ```json
   {
     "siteVisible": true,
     "licenseValid": true,
     "message": "Licensed to Seismic AI (Turbo AI collaboration project)",
     "timestamp": "2025-10-28T00:00:00Z",
     "developer": "akshay-rajeev-nambiar",
     "paymentStatus": "authorized"
   }
   ```

**Remote Control:**

- **Take site offline:** Edit the file, change `"siteVisible": false`, commit
- **Block unauthorized deployment:** Change `"licenseValid": false`, commit
- **Custom messages:** Update `"message"` field with any text you want
- **Works from anywhere:** Phone, web browser, GitHub mobile app

## 🔧 Core Files

### **License Control System:**
