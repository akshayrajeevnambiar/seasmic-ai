# Professional Team Portraits

## Required Founder Photos

To replace the placeholder team images, you'll need professional headshots (400x400px) for:

### Jude Tharakan - CEO & Co-founder

- **Background**: Former Energy Innovation Lead at Shell
- **File**: `/assets/team/jude-tharakan.jpg`
- **Style**: Professional business portrait, neutral background
- **Resolution**: 400x400px, optimized for web

### Ravindra Khare - CTO & Co-founder

- **Background**: AI Research Director at IIT Bombay
- **File**: `/assets/team/ravindra-khare.jpg`
- **Style**: Professional business portrait, neutral background
- **Resolution**: 400x400px, optimized for web

### Dr. Sarah Chen - Head of Operations

- **Background**: Former Oxford Geophysics Professor
- **File**: `/assets/team/sarah-chen.jpg`
- **Style**: Professional business portrait, neutral background
- **Resolution**: 400x400px, optimized for web

## Portrait Guidelines

- **Lighting**: Professional studio lighting or well-lit environment
- **Background**: Neutral (gray, white, or subtle gradient)
- **Expression**: Professional, confident, approachable
- **Crop**: Head and shoulders, centered composition
- **Format**: JPG or WebP, optimized for web (under 50KB each)
- **Consistency**: Similar lighting and style across all portraits

## Temporary Solution

Until real portraits are available, the current implementation uses:

- Gradient placeholder backgrounds
- Professional styling with hover effects
- Proper alt text and accessibility features

The layout is designed to seamlessly accommodate real photographs when available.
